We have created different Portal effects 
and all the effects can be modified easily because each effect has multiple child and each child has its 
own unique texture if you want to create a new effect so you have to update textures which you want 
and also change the colors according to your taste. In this pack we have created different Rounded 
shapes effect, trails effect, fog effect, spark effects, smoke effects, and glow effects etc. By using unique 
textures for rounded shapes, texture-sheet for smoke effect and all other textures which we used for 
trails, spark and glow effects. For smoke effect you can update color opacity according to you 
requirement because all the effects has its own color opacity.
Portal Pack consists of 12 different visual effects which are created individually, so you can use them to 
create an intuitive and eye-catching user interface for your 3D game and animated environment. These 
visual effects can be edited and placed at any scene in the 3D environment to give it more defined look.
